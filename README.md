# Fish Shop - neuefische recap project

This is a fish shop app, which fetches data from a mongo db and renders the products as card components. You can also add new fishes, update existing ones or delete them from the database.

This was one of my later next.js recap projects in my web development bootcamp at neuefische, which also included a MongoDB implementation via Atlas and the API routes.
